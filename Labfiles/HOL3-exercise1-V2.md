# HOL 3: Onboard On-premises servers to Azure Arc-Enabled Server (Optional)

## Exercise 1: Run workloads anywhere with Azure Cloud Services

In this Exercise, you will deploy and configure the Azure Connected Machine agent on a Windows machine hosted outside of Azure.

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview
In this HOL, you will use the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment tool that describes how to onboard on-premises Hyper-V VMs to Azure Arc for Azure Management.

Azure Arc allows you to manage your hybrid IT estate with a single pane of glass by extending the Azure management experience to your on-premises servers, which are not ideal candidates for migration.

## Objectives

In this Exercise, you will complete the following task:

- Task 1: Run workloads anywhere with Azure Cloud Services

### Task 1: Run workloads anywhere with Azure Cloud Services

In this task, you will deploy and configure the Azure Connected Machine agent on a Windows machine hosted outside of Azure, to ensure that it can be managed through Azure Arc-enabled servers.

1. In the search bar of the Azure portal, type **Azure arc (1)** and select **Azure Arc (2)** from suggestions under Services, as shown below:

    >**Note:** If you are unable to find the state for the **AzureArcVM (1)** VM as Running, then select **Start (2)** in the Actions pane on the right.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager showing the start button for the AzureArcVM.](Images/infra-l9-3.png "Start AzureArcVM")    
    
1. In Hyper-V Manager, select the **AzureArcVM (1)** VM, then select **Connect (2)** in the Actions pane on the right.

    ![Screenshot of Hyper-V Manager showing the connect button for the AzureArcVM.](Images/infra-l10-2-new.png "Connect to AzureArcVM")  
    
1. Under Connect to AzureArcVM, click on **Connect** and then log into the VM with the **Administrator password**: **<inject key="SmartHotel Admin Password" />** (If the copy/paste is not working in the hyper-V machine, please try typing the password. The login screen may pick up your local keyboard mapping, use the 'eyeball' icon to check).

1. From the **Start** menu of the AzureArcVM, search for **Windows Powershell (1)** and open it **(2)**.

    ![Screenshot of the PowerShell.](Images/infra-l10-3.png)
      
1. In PowerShell, run the following command to set the execution policy as unrestricted.

    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
    ```
   >**Note:** If you get an option, "Do you want to change the execution policy?", please type A and press Enter. 

1. Now, run the whole script that you copied in Notepad earlier in **step 6**.

1. After running the script, packages will be installed, and then you will be directed to a pop-up browser page to log into your Azure account for authentication purposes. Use the below Azure credentials:

    - Enter your Username/Email: **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>**  in the Sign in field. Click Next to continue.
